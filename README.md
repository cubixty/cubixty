<h1 align="center">Hello!</h1>

<p>Hi. I'm Cubixty. I love anything to do with computers which includes coding ofcourse. I also love everything to do with cars especailly tuner cars. My favorite cars are probably the Nissan 240SX or Nissan R32 GTR. I also love gaming , my main games being simulators and League of Legends with the occasional Counter-Strike and Valorant.</p>

I started coding a few years ago but only ever learnt HTML and CSS though I am currently learning Java and JavaScript. I also am planning to learn some NodeJS on the side to start coding some disocrd bots just for fun.

I hope you enjoyed reading my profile!
